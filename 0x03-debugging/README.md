#Debugging 
Project aims to learn how to debug in C language
##Technologies
* C files are compiled using gcc
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
##Files
All files are programs written in C:
0. 0-main.c - Test that function 'positive_or_negative()' gives the correct output when given a case of 0
1. '1-main.c' - Fixed program to the infinite loop
2. '2-largest_number.c' - prints the largest number of three integers
3. '3-print_remaining_days.c' - converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year
['main.c' - header file]
