* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* gcc, using the options [-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89]
### Synopsis
This project introduces functions and nested loops in C programming. Each .c file contains a different function while the main.h file contains all the function prototypes.
### Description of what each file does:
0. prints putchar
1. prints the alphabet, in lowercase
2. prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase
3. checks for lowercase character
4. checks for alphabetic character
5. prints the sign of a number
6. computes the absolute value of an integer
7. prints the last digit of a number
8. prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59
9. prints 9 times table, starting with 0
10. adds two integers and returns the result
11. prints all the natural numbers from n to 98
12. prints the n times table, starting with 0
13. computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5, below 1024(excluded)
14. prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
15. finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms
16. finds and prints 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
